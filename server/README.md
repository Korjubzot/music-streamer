# Server

This is the server portion of this project. It runs using node.js and has one main command.

```
node server.js
```

There is also a knexfile to handle migrations. I've forgotten how that works, unfortunately.

## Todo

Fill this in later...

- [ ] Relearn how Knex works
- [ ] Expand migrations for songs, artists, and albums + populate with some data
- [ ] Build basic routing for each
